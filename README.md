# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Course-with-Andrew-Ng
Introductory Machine Learning Course from Standford 

Goes over the basic Machine Learning Techniques that are common in the field. 

## Week 2: Linear Regression 

Purpose: Learn about a Machine Learning Technique that will draw a trendline that can relate a set of features to an output. 

In the course, Linear Regression was one of the first techniques introduced in the course. If we had a dataset on housing prices for example, one would find that the price of the house varies depending on certain key factors. Some of these factors are things like square footage, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, Number of floors etc. 

| Size    | Number of bedrooms      | Number of floors| Price($1000)   
| ------------- | ------------- | --------    | ---------
| 2104      | 1    | 45   | 460
| 1416         | 2   | 40   | 232
